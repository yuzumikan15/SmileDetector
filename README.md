# SmileDetector
iOS application that detects user's smile as a face feature. Just make a smile to inside-camera during you see a pic of delicious food.

This app is a very simple version of [Gankin-Alarm](https://itunes.apple.com/jp/app/yan-jinaramu/id1017424439?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4). You need to download all the image files from [here](http://www.tbs.co.jp/anime/koufuku_g/special/) to build the app. (You might also need to rename those images.)
